# First Steps in Linear Algebra for Machine Learning

## Overview

The main goal of the course is to explain the main concepts of linear algebra that are used in data analysis and machine learning. Another goal is to improve the studentâ€™s practical skills of using linear algebra methods in machine learning and data analysis. You will learn the fundamentals of working with data in vector and matrix form, acquire skills for solving systems of linear algebraic equations and finding the basic matrix decompositions and general understanding of their applicability.

## Key Concepts by Week

Week 1, Systems of linear equations and linear classifier
> In the first week we provide an introduction to multi-dimensional geometry and matrix algebra. After that, we study methods for finding linear system solutions based on Gaussian eliminations and LU-decompositions. We illustrate the methods with Python code examples of matrix calculations.

- Learn basic operations with matrices in Python
- Learn basics of operations with matrices.
- Learn about LU decomposition and how to find it.
- Learn how to do matrix operations and LU decomposition in Python.
- Learn how to find the inverse of a matrix.
- Understand how to use operations with matrices to find solution for a system of linear algebraic equations (SLAE).

Week 2, Full rank decomposition and systems of linear equations
> The second week is devoted to getting to know some fundamental notions of linear algebra, namely: vector spaces, linear independence, and basis. Next, we will discuss what a rank of a matrix is, and how it could help us decompose a matrix. In addition, we will talk about the properties of a set of solutions for a system of linear equations. At the end of this week we will apply this theory to a scanned document processing.

- Understand how to apply theory on the "scanned document problem".
- Understand the notion of the rank of the matrix.
- Understand vector spaces and basis.
- Understand the properties of a set of solutions for a system of linear equations.
- Apply rank to determine the number of linearly independent solutuions for a system of linear equations.

Week 3, Euclidean spaces
> In the third week, we firstly introduce coordinates in an abstract vector space. This allows us to apply the usual matrix arithmetic to abstract vectors. Next, we discuss the concept of Euclidean space which allows us to measure distances and angles in vector spaces. Then we use these measures in the least squares method to find approximate solutions of linear systems and in the linear regression model based on it. Finally, we describe the core of the most common linear classifier called Support Vector Machine.

- Understand the support vector machine (SVM) method.
- Explain Eucledian vector space and how to measure distances and angles in it.
- Learn how to use Linear Regression and SVM in Python.
- Understand coordinates in abstract vector spaces.
- Use distances and orthogonal projections in the least squares method.

- Use SVM model for data analysis
- Analyze the data and make conclusions on the findings
